The solution is to use strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`). Strict comparison checks both value and type, preventing the unexpected equality between '0' and 0.  This ensures that the conditional logic behaves as intended.

```php
<?php
$value = '0';

if ($value === 0) { // Strict comparison
  echo "Value is numerically 0";
} else {
  echo "Value is not numerically 0";
}
?>
```
